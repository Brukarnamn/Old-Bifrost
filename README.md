# Bifrost-bot

  <https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint/blob/master/docs/RULES.md>

  Written by Nokoüç£#1335 @ Discord <@210866460950659072>.

  NOTE: Code has not been updated for Discord's changes in intent policies. Nor
  has it been updated to reflect changes to discord.rb and Ruby 3.+ since the
  code was originally released many years ago.

  Some of the individual code might still work though, so leaving it up for
  anyone that might happen to see it, before they gauge their eyes out.

## Bifrost / Bivrost / Bifr√∂st / Bilr√∂st

Bifrost, also called √Ösbroen (√Åsbr√∫) is the name of the rainbow in
Norse mythology. The gods built the rainbow bridge as a pathway from the
earth (Midgard) and into the sky (Asgard), the realm of the gods.

The god Heimdall sits at the edge of Asgard and guards Bifrost from the
mountain jotnar.

The bridge will collapse when the sons of Muspell ride it during Ragnarok.

## Some features

* ...

## To-do list

* In progress: Rewrite the entire code.

## Known issues

* The server's role names need to be uniquely spelled for the mapping from
  role command into role names to work properly.

  * Test_123456789012345678 ‚Üí Test Role Name
  * Test_234567890123456789 ‚Üí Test Role Name

  Both map into the same.

## Installation

The following Ruby gems are required in order to run the bot:

* `discordrb` (and its dependencies).
  * <https://github.com/meew0/discordrb>
  * <http://www.rubydoc.info/github/meew0/discordrb/toplevel>
* `sqlite3` (and its dependencies) for some persistent storage.
  * <https://sqlite.org/download.html>
* `hpricot` (and its dependencies) to parse html.

### 1

Update all installed gems.

  `gem update --platform=ruby`

If and only if you have two versions of openssl:
For example if you get LoadError (... Ruby25-x64/lib/ruby/gems/2.5.0/gems/openssl-2.1.2/lib/openssl.so)

  `gem uninstall openssl` or `gem uninstall openssl -v 2.1.2`

Make sure you have the `bundler` gem installed.
In Windows, open `Command Prompt with Ruby` and type

  `gem install bundle --platform=ruby`

### 2

Download, extract and install `sqlite3` from

  <https://sqlite.org/download.html>

If necessary, modify the PATH-variable or copy the executables into Ruby's executable bin-folder.
Then install the Ruby `sqlite3` gem:

  `gem install sqlite3 --platform=ruby -- --with-sqlite3-dir=c:/path/to/sqlite3/executable --with-sqlite3-include=c:/path/to/sqlite3/c-and-h-sources --with-sqlite3-libc:/path/to/sqlite3/dll-or-o-libraries`

for example:

  `gem install sqlite3 --platform=ruby -- --with-sqlite3-dir=p:/ruby/discordbot/sqlite3 --with-sqlite3-include=p:/ruby/discordbot/sqlite3/sources --with-sqlite3-lib=p:/ruby/discordbot/sqlite3`

Database browser for SQLite:

  <http://sqlitebrowser.org/>

#### With Ruby 2.5 on Windows

Get autoconf version of sqlite3 sources from <https://www.sqlite.org/download.html>
Start msys shell of DevKit:

  `C:\bin\Ruby25-x64\msys64\mingw64.exe`

Cd to unpacked location for your sqlite3

  `cd /p/Ruby/Discordbot/sqlite3/sqlite-autoconf-3250200/`

In unpacked location for your sqlite3 configure static version only to avoid keeping DLL on PATH

  `./configure --disable-shared`

Build and install it

  `make`
  `make install DESTDIR=/c/bin/Ruby25-x64/msys64` OR `make install`

Remove all existing sqlite3 gems

  `gem uninstall sqlite3 --all`

Build and install this gem

  `gem install sqlite3 --platform=ruby -- --with-sqlite3-include=c:/bin/Ruby25-x64/msys64/include --with-sqlite3-lib=c:/bin/Ruby25-x64/msys64/lib`

### 3

Then run `bundle install` (needs to be fixed, in the meantime you can manually install:)

* gem install bundler rake ast ffi unf_ext unf domain_name http-cookie mime-types-data mime-types netrc rest-client --platform=ruby
* gem install discordrb-webhooks opus-ruby rbnacl event_emitter websocket websocket-client-simple discordrb --platform=ruby
* gem install imgkit json mini_portile2 parallel parser powerpack rainbow ruby-progressbar unicode-display_width rubocop --platform=ruby
* gem install thor yard eventmachine reverse_markdown kramdown htmlentities coderay jaro_winkler tilt solargraph --platform=ruby
* gem install awesome_print --platform=ruby
* gem install nokogiri hpricot --platform=ruby

### Ruby 2.5 WARNING

There is a broken dependency in the latest gem (3.2.1) and for some Windows Ruby 2.5 users, you'll find the library silently errors out.
This is fixed in the master version, so to fix this, you can either

* use up to date master (We recommend using bundler. See ?ahh bundler for more information)
* install the gem dependency with `gem install rest-client --pre --platform=ruby`
* Use Ruby 2.4 or under, or the latest 2.5 available, with bugfixes.

### 4

Copy the configuration file in the `data` folder:

  `copy server_secrets_example.yml server_secrets.yml`

then edit the new file and fill in your secret keys.

### 5

Edit

  `server_configs.yml`

in the `data` folder and fill in your server's IDs and channel IDs.

  <https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me>

to get the Discord token (The bot's password).

### 7

Press `+` for a new app.

### 8
