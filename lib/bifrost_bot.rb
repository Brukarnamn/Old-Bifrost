  Attributes to initialize a normal Bot with:
  ===========================================
  https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/discordrb/Discordrb/Bot#initialize-instance_method

  log_mode (Symbol) —
    The mode this bot should use for logging. See Logger#mode= for a list of modes.

  token (String) —
    The token that should be used to log in. If your bot is a bot account, you have to specify this. If you're logging in as a user, make sure to also set the account type to :user so discordrb doesn't think you're trying to log in as a bot.

  client_id (Integer) —
    If you're logging in as a bot, the bot's client ID.

  type (Symbol) —
    This parameter lets you manually overwrite the account type. This needs to be set when logging in as a user, otherwise discordrb will treat you as a bot account. Valid values are :user and :bot.

  name (String) —
    Your bot's name. This will be sent to Discord with any API requests, who will use this to trace the source of excessive API requests; it's recommended to set this to something if you make bots that many people will host on their servers separately.

  fancy_log (true, false) —
    Whether the output log should be made extra fancy using ANSI escape codes. (Your terminal may not support this.)

  suppress_ready (true, false) —
    Whether the READY packet should be exempt from being printed to console. Useful for very large bots running in debug or verbose log_mode.

  parse_self (true, false) —
    Whether the bot should react on its own messages. It's best to turn this off unless you really need this so you don't inadvertently create infinite loops.

  shard_id (Integer) —
    The number of the shard this bot should handle. See https://github.com/hammerandchisel/discord-api-docs/issues/17 for how to do sharding.

  num_shards (Integer) —
    The total number of shards that should be running. See https://github.com/hammerandchisel/discord-api-docs/issues/17 for how to do sharding.

  redact_token (true, false) —
    Whether the bot should redact the token in logs. Default is true.

  ignore_bots (true, false) —
    Whether the bot should ignore bot accounts or not. Default is false.


  Additional attributes to initialize the CommandBot with:
  ========================================================
  https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/discordrb/Discordrb/Commands/CommandBot#initialize-instance_method

  :prefix (String, Array<String>, #call) —
    The prefix that should trigger this bot's commands. It can be:
      * Any string (including the empty string).
        This has the effect that if a message starts with the prefix, the prefix will be stripped and the rest of the chain will be parsed as a command chain.
        Note that it will be literal - if the prefix is "hi" then the corresponding trigger string for a command called "test" would be "hitest".
        Don't forget to put spaces in if you need them!
      * An array of prefixes.
        Those will behave similarly to setting one string as a prefix, but instead of only one string, any of the strings in the array can be used.
      * Something Proc-like (responds to :call) that takes a Message object as an argument and returns either the command chain in raw form or nil if the given
        message shouldn't be parsed.
        This can be used to make more complicated dynamic prefixes (e. g. based on server), or even something else entirely (suffixes, or most adventurous, infixes).

  :advanced_functionality (true, false) —
    Whether to enable advanced functionality (very powerful way to nest commands into chains, see https://github.com/meew0/discordrb/wiki/Commands#command-chain-syntax for info. Default is false.

  :help_command (Symbol, Array<Symbol>, false) —
    The name of the command that displays info for other commands. Use an array if you want to have aliases. Default is "help". If none should be created, use false as the value.

  :command_doesnt_exist_message (String) —
    The message that should be displayed if a user attempts to use a command that does not exist. If none is specified, no message will be displayed. In the message, you can use the string '%command%' that will be replaced with the name of the command.

  :no_permission_message (String) —
    The message to be displayed when NoPermission error is raised.

  :spaces_allowed (true, false) —
    Whether spaces are allowed to occur between the prefix and the command. Default is false.

  :webhook_commands (true, false) —
    Whether messages sent by webhooks are allowed to trigger commands. Default is true.

  :channels (Array<String, Integer, Channel>) —
    The channels this command bot accepts commands on. Superseded if a command has a 'channels' attribute.

  :previous (String) —
    Character that should designate the result of the previous command in a command chain (see :advanced_functionality). Default is '~'.

  :chain_delimiter (String) —
    Character that should designate that a new command begins in the command chain (see :advanced_functionality). Default is '>'.

  :chain_args_delim (String) —
    Character that should separate the command chain arguments from the chain itself (see :advanced_functionality). Default is ':'.

  :sub_chain_start (String) —
    Character that should start a sub-chain (see :advanced_functionality). Default is '['.

  :sub_chain_end (String) —
    Character that should end a sub-chain (see :advanced_functionality). Default is ']'.

  :quote_start (String) —
    Character that should start a quoted string (see :advanced_functionality). Default is '"'.

  :quote_end (String) —
    Character that should end a quoted string (see :advanced_functionality). Default is '"'.

  :ignore_bots (true, false) —
    Whether the bot should ignore bot accounts or not. Default is false.
